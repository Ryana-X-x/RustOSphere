# **RustOSphere**
-----------------
## Project Overview
- Custom Virtual Machine:
A lightweight VM designed to emulate a basic CPU, memory, and I/O.
Implements an instruction fetch-decode-execute cycle.

- Operating System:
Built from scratch in Rust with a custom bootloader and kernel.
Includes memory management, multitasking, and basic system calls.
Shell Interface:

- Text-based shell for user interaction.
Allows execution of system commands and loading games for the emulator.
Retro Game Emulator:

- An NES emulator built into the OS to run old-school games.
Simulates the NES CPU (6502), PPU (Picture Processing Unit), and APU (Audio Processing Unit).
-------------------
## Core Objectives

- Learn Systems Programming: Gain deep experience in Rust and low-level programming.
- Explore OS Development: Build components like bootloaders, kernels, and shells.
- Master Emulation: Create a functional NES emulator as a challenging and rewarding system-level task.
- Demonstrate Expertise: Showcase knowledge in operating systems and emulation, valuable skills in systems programming roles.
